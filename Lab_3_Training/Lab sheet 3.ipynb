    "## 2. Batch-based training\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this lab session we shall see what batch-based training means.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a batch?\n",
    "\n",
    "They say there is no such thing as a stupid question, so let's first make sure we all know what a batch is.  \n",
    "**A batch is a set of data points**.  \n",
    "For example, in CIFAR-10, a data point is a single image, while a batch of size 16 is a set of 16 images. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a training batch?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a set of data points we use to train our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is batch-based training?\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch-based training refers to train a neural network using multiple data points as opposed to a single data point. We referred to the gradient descent optimisation that uses a batch as *stochastic gradient descent*.\n",
    "As a matter of fact, there is no real network that can learn anything sensible without batch training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hang on a minute, didn't our CNN take a single image as input?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it does. Our first CNN takes one single image as input and outputs the confidence of the network of recognising that image as one of the 10 objects.  \n",
    "However, when we train our network, we do it considering a batch of images, i.e. we adjust the parameters of the network by looking at multiple images, as opposed to just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is batch-based training important?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in CIFAR-10, a data point is a single image, while a batch of size 16 is a set of 16 images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's have a look\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look now at the code in ``cifer_hyperparm.py``, which you copied from ``Lab_2``. Amongst the parameters (flags) we set, notice now the following:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "tf.app.flags.DEFINE_integer('batch-size', 128)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you'll have already guessed, this parameter controls the batch size, i.e. how many images will be used in a mini-batch to train the network.  \n",
    "Let's see how much this parameter impacts the accuracy of our model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### PRACTICAL 2.1: Adjusting the batch size\n",

    "2. Train your model **as is** using the current batch size and training rate, and note the **test accuracy**\n",
    "3. Set the batch size to 16, and train your model. What is the effect on the **test accuracy**?\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, many gradient descent algorithms work with a non constant learning rate, that is the learning rate is lowered over time during training.  \n",
    "The basic concept behind learning rate decay is that we first descend the gradient more quickly when we start training the model, say when we \"still have much to learn\", and then slow down as we proceed, since learning \"new things\" after a while requires more time and care.  \n",

    "## 5. Batch normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of each layer's input, i.e. either the input data itself or the output from intermediate layers, plays a crucial role when training (especially) deep neural networks. The main issue is that the distribution of the input data (recall we are using batch-based training) - and thus the distibution of the input to the following layers - varies while we train and while we learn the optimal parameters for our task. This phenomenon is typically referred to as _internal covariate shift_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be helpful for our network if such distributions didn't change much as we observe new input data and generate intermediate layer outputs while training and adjusting the model's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what batch normalisation does by normalising layer inputs. It was proposed by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy at Google [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf). Let's see in detail how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the paper:  \n",
    "\n",
    ">By fixing the distribution of the layer inputs as the training progresses, we expect to improve the training speed. It has been long known that the network training converges faster if its inputs are whitened – i.e., linearly transformed to have zero means and unit variances, and decorrelated. As each layer observes the inputs produced by the layers below, it would be advantageous to achieve the same whitening of the inputs of each layer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\text{x} = (\\textit{x}^{(1)}, \\dots, \\textit{x}^{(d)})$ be a d-dimensional input vector to a certain layer in our network. We have to normalise each scalar feature independently by making it have mean 0 and variance 1. We do this for each dimension $k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x}^{(k)} = \\frac{x^{(k)} - \\text{E}[x^{(k)}]}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}[x^{(k)}] + \\epsilon}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the expectation and variance are computed **over the training batch**, and $\\epsilon$ is a constant added for numerical stability. Let's quote again the paper now:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Such normalization speeds up convergence, even when the features are not decorrelated. Note that simply normalizing each input of a layer may change what the layer can represent. To address this, we make sure that the transformation inserted in the network can represent the identity transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we add for each dimension $k$ a pair of new parameters $\\gamma ^{(k)}, \\beta ^{(k)}$. The output of the layer to which we are feeding the normalised vector $\\bar{\\text{x}}$ would then be\n",

    "There are a few strategies to generate initial parameters out there. One of the most used is **Xavier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initialiser is designed to keep the scale of the gradients roughly the same in all layers. Weights can be generated using either a uniform or a normal distribution. For the uniform distribution, given a layer $l$ with size $s(l)$, its parameters will be initialised uniformly from the following interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $s(l+1)$ is the size of the following layer $l+1$. Note that the size of a layer corresponds in this case to the number of columns of its weight matrix. For the normal distribution, initial weights for a layer $l$ are sampled from a normal distribution whose standard deviation depends on $l$ and $l+i$'s sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Var[W(l)] = \\frac{2}{s(l) + s(l+1)}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "For a comprehensive explaination of why these magic numbers provide a good parameter initialisation, I recommend you read [the original paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf).\n",
    "In tensorflow, using Xavier initialisation is pretty straightforward. All we need to do is to use the initialiser object:\n",

    "# the initialiser object implementing Xavier initialisation\n",
    "# we will generate weights from the uniform distribution\n",
    "xavier_initializer = tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(uniform=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, in our custom functions generating initial weights we simply do:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def weight_variable(shape):\n",
    "  \"\"\"weight_variable generates a weight variable of a given shape.\"\"\"\n",
    "  #initial = tf.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=0.1)\n",
    "  #initial = tf.zeros(shape)\n",
    "  #initial = tf.ones(shape)\n",
    "      \n",
    "  #return tf.Variable(initial, name='weights')\n",
    "  return tf.Variable(xavier_initializer(shape)) # using Xavier initialisation\n",

    "  #initial = tf.constant(0.1, shape=shape)\n",
    "  #return tf.Variable(initial, name='biases')\n",
    "\n",
    "  return tf.Variable(xavier_initializer(shape)) # using Xavier initialisation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there is no need to have different functions since both do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running our model with Xavier initialisation for 10,000 steps, with batch normalisation and (decaying) learning rate 1.00E-03, we reach 75% accuracy on the test set! Another improvement, yay! \n",
