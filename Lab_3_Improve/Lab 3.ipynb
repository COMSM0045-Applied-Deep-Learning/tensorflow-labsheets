    "We've taken a modified version of the code we've given you for lab 2, instead of using ops defined in the `tf.nn` module to build the network we move to using ops from the `tf.layers` module which is a higher level interface making it easier to try new architectures. We started with `tf.nn` to show you the nuts and bolts of neural networks so nothing was hidden. The `tf.layers` ops are defined in a very similar way to the layers you used in the previous lab, except that they are parameterised so you don't have to repeat the same code over and over again.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally the more data a CNN (or any deep learning model) has access to the better features it learns, and therefore the better it performs. Data augmentation refers to techniques to artificially increase the amount of training data with label preserving transformations on the original training data, i.e. we want to transform CIFAR-10 images in such a way that the data becomes more varied but the object in the image remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to implement data augmentation *online* where each training mini-batch is loaded and mutated stocastically in some way (e.g. rotation, translation, blurring). Recall that we don't stop training after having processed the full dataset but after some other stopping criteria and so it is possible, even probable, that we will process each training example more than once. If we mutate the inputs stochastically then each time an example is part of a mini-batch it will be mutated in some different way (e.g. rotating by an angle sampled from a random distribution)."

    "One thing to bear in mind when debugging tensorflow is that you *can't* easily use a normal python `print` statement. This is because tensorflow works by first building a computational graph and then evaluating the graph. You cannot print a value until it has been evaluated in the graph. To add a print operation to a tensorflow graph you use `tf.Print`. For example:\n",
