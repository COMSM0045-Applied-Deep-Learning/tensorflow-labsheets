Data augmentation refers to techniques to artificially increase the amount of training data with label preserving transformations on the original training data, i.e. we want to transform CIFAR-10 images in such a way that the data becomes more varied but the object in the image remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to implement data augmentation *online* where each training mini-batch is loaded and mutated stocastically in some way (e.g. rotation, translation, blurring). Recall that we don't stop training after having processed the full dataset but after some other stopping criteria and so it is possible, even probable, that we will process each training example more than once. If we mutate the inputs stochastically then each time an example is part of a mini-batch it will be mutated in some different way (e.g. rotating by an angle sampled from a random distribution)."

    "## 4. Debugging Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In Labs 1 and 2 you have seen how to use tensorflow to view how the accuracy and loss change over time. This is one of the most valuable tools for gaining insight into what your network is doing and debugging it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to bear in mind when debugging tensorflow is that you *can't* easily use a normal python `print` statement. This is because tensorflow works by first building a computational graph and then evaluating the graph. You cannot print a value until it has been evaluated in the graph. To add a print operation to a tensorflow graph you use `tf.Print`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = tf.get_variable('x', [10, 5])\n",
